# Alzhiemer's-classification-using-a-novel-deep-learning-model-architecture-based-on-EEG-signals

A novel Deeplearning approach with Attention mechanisms & Cosine similarity function.

With three different classes of Patients AD(Alzhiemer Disease),MCI(Mild-Cognitive-Impairment),HC(Healthy Control or Normal)

The dataset provided is the readings of EEG(Electro-encephalography) signal of each patient class and are matlab files.
